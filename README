From website:

This plugin is a great way to get a quick date picker in jQuery. Unfortunately it stopped working as of jQuery 1.7 because of deprecation of $.event and changes to how class attributes are handled. I have fixed these, and will try and maintain/add to the plugin as I see fit.

I have also added a useful document.ready helper - any input with the class of "date" will change automatically. I will attempt to make further changes so that the plugin works with [type="date"] but this breaks it in some browsers at present.

I forgot to initialise my git repo before making changes, I'll try and make a diff so it is obvious what I've changed.
